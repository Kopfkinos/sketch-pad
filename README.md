Live version - https://kopfkinos.github.io/sketch-pad/

This is a simple sketch pad project as part of the Odin projects foundations course. 

It is a project allowing me to practice my Javascript and CSS skills. 

The "sketchpad" in the center of the page can be drawn onto by hovering the mouse over it. 
Each "pixel" will gradually increase in opacity the more it is drawn over. 
The user can select which colour they wish to use from a colour wheel, or turn on a colour randomiser toggle.
The user can also change the pixel density of the sketch pad, or reset the start afresh.
